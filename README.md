Sir, how I came about this project was with  the help of a video I saw on youtube  where they were  explaining how to get the Netflix  front-page.

So I downloaded the Netflix image, and also the background image which I used on my project, and I used linear-gradient on the css to make the background image dark.

On the footer I made a list of all the items that will appear, and gave them a column-count which is exactly four columns on the main Netflix page on the css,  I even gave them a column-width and a column-gap which will gave them space from each other.

How I got the exact colours of the page was with the use of  a browser extension on chrome called color-zilla.
